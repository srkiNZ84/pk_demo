# Public Key Encryption demo
An attempt by myself to give a trivial working example of public key encryption. While not an example with real-world
uses, it should demonstrate the fundamental concepts using working code.

V1 - Java program that encrypts and decrypts a string
V2 - Add a Perl program that encrypts and decrypts a string
V3 - Get the Java program and Perl program passing messages securely
